# Vision-Assistant
A low-cost assistive technology device for the blind and visually impaired that uses computer vision models to extract text from the real world and reads the extracted text aloud to users in real-time.

 - The device was built entirely using open-source hardware and deep learning models.
 - This repository contains all the code that runs on the device's hardware.

 - The device is capable of working both online and offline, but produces more accurate results and more natural-sounding speech when connected to the internet.

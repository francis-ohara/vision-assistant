THE COLBY AFFIRMATION.

Honesty, integrity, and personal responsibility are cornerstones of a Colby education and provide the foundation for scholarly inquiry, intellectual discourse, and an open and welcoming campus community. Recognizing that promoting and safeguarding a culture of academic integrity and social accountability requires vigilance and active participation from all members of the community, the College appointed a task force of students, faculty, staff, and members of the Board of Trustees that developed the Colby Affirmation. All members of the Colby community are expected to live by the tenets of individual accountability and collective responsibility articulated in the Colby Affirmation.

Colby College is a community dedicated to learning and committed to the growth and well-being of all its members.

As a community devoted to intellectual growth, we value academic integrity. We agree to take ownership of our academic work, to submit only work that is our own, to fully acknowledge the research and ideas of others in our work, and to abide by the instructions and regulations governing academic work established by the faculty.

As a community built on respect for ourselves, each other, and our physical environment, we recognize the diversity of people who have gathered here and that genuine inclusivity requires active, honest, and compassionate engagement with one another. We agree to respect each other, to honor community expectations, and to comply with College policies.

As a member of this community, I pledge to hold myself and others accountable to these values.
